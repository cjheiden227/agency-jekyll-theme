My work as a professional writer is founded on this principle, while also ensuring that I tell the right story, in the right way, to the right audience at the right time. My experience includes email marketing and appeals, internal and external corporate and nonprofit communications, proposals, television scripts, fiction, and more. </p>

I try to learn something from every task and project. In 2016, while working full-time, I completed my Master's degree in Communications & Leadership from Gonzaga University. I am also an avid reader whose taste in books range from fantasy like <em>Outlander</em> to nonfiction such as <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</em> and everything in between. </p>
