After my career in entertainment, I have used my storytelling foundations to help various non-profit organizations increase their constituentsâ€™ engagement and affinity, secure significant financial support, and build a positive image in the community. My work as a professional writer spans everything from proposals to grant writing to corporate communications. </p>
