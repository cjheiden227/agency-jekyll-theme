                                    <p class="text-muted">My work as a professional writer spans everything from corporate communications to scripted television. My early career in entertainment built a solid foundation of storytelling. After my career in television, I used my storytelling foundation to help various non-profit organizations increase their constituents’ engagement and affinity, secure significant financial support, and build a positive image in the community. This is the “happily ever after” I strive towards every day in my career.</p>
