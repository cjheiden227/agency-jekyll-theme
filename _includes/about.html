                                    <p class="text-muted">For over a decade, my work as a professional writer spans everything from corporate communications to scripted television. My early career in entertainment built a solid foundation of storytelling. After my career in television, I used my storytelling foundation to help various non-profit organizations. I told the story of the space shuttle Endevaour coming to Los Angeles at the California Science Center's Samuel Oshin Air and Space Center, the stories of children with mobility issues in Indonesia and the joy the gift of mobility brought them, and many more. My storytelling skills helped these organizations increase their constituents’ engagement and affinity, secure significant financial support, and build a positive image in the community. This is the “happily ever after” I strive towards every day in my career.</p>
