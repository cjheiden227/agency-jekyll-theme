description: <h3>Why I Like It </h3>This article told the heartwarming story of a multigenerational Mines family, capturing the similarities and differences of their Mines experiences over the years and school spirit they share for life. I made sure to diversify my questions to fit each member of the family and all of them as a group. Organizing and executing these interviews as well as creating a holistic piece out of them was a challenging, enjoyable, and ultimately successful process. <br> <br> <a class="btn btn btn-primary" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SgIvQK7_dPxl3422V3SBUSRwCeDgIx4_/view?usp=sharing" target="_">See It Here</a>
