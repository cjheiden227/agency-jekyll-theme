description: <h3>Why I Like It</h3>Interesting storytelling isn’t usually what comes to mind when people think of the word “proposal.” I know it’s an imperative part of the process and was sure to incorporate it in this piece along with necessary practical information. I am proud to say that it worked; this proposal helped secure a $30 million investment, the largest individual gift in Colorado School of Mines’ history. I also enjoyed the strategic collaboration with colleagues and executives that was critical to inform my writing.<br><br><a class="btn btn btn-primary" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cPIkFoDn-RkBw3HgAcQzPvpV6ypEhCCl/view?usp=sharing" target="_">See It Here</a>
