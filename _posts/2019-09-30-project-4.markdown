description: <h3>Why I Like It</h3>This started as a tool to help me understand the journey students take through the new Entrepreneurship & Innovation programming at Colorado School of Mines. Ultimately, it turned into a conceptual framework that would serve as the basis for explaining E&I to a variety of internal and external audiences. Using a more systems-thinking approach along with my creativity was a treat on this project.<br><br><a class="btn btn btn-primary" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y7FubXI-WVptjvDFi9Qo_yO5G2qcxpKz/view?usp=sharing" target="_">See It Here</a>
