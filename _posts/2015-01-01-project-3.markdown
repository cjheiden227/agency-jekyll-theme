description: <h3>Why I Like It</h3> When one of the executives at the California Science Center asked for a volunteer to conceptualize and write this brochure, I leaped at the chance. I collaborated cross-departmentally to produce the final piece, which was proudly shared with everyone from funders to the general public. Creating this brochure, I loved breaking down the Science Centerâ€™s mission in a way that told its story as a community resource, a hub for curiosity and learning, and a fun destination for anyone. <br> <br><a class="btn btn btn-primary" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LXcBxfjx8h-BsDXcZ3ZUlO14wg4Gc1AO/view?usp=sharing" target="_">See It Here</a>
